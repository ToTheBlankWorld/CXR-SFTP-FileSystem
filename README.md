### Docker Deployment (Self-Hosted)

1. Install `docker.io` and `docker-compose`

2. Create `docker-compose.yml` with the following template:

   ```bash
   version: '3.8'

   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:17-alpine   # lightweight, recent version; 16 or 15 also fine
       container_name: cxr-lab-db
       restart: unless-stopped
       environment:
         POSTGRES_USER: cxrlab          # change if you want
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your-secure-password-here   #  ^f^p CHANGE THIS to something strong
         POSTGRES_DB: cxrlabdb              # database name CXR-Lab will use
       volumes:
         - ./postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data   # persistent storage
       healthcheck:
         test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U cxrlab -d cxrlabdb"]
         interval: 10s
         timeout: 5s
         retries: 5

     cxrlab:
       image: totheblankworld/cxr-lab-file-system:latest
       container_name: cxr-lab-app
       restart: unless-stopped
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"                     # change left side if you want different host port
       environment:
         DATABASE_URL: postgresql://cxrlab:your-secure-password-here@db:5432/cxrlabdb?schema=public
         NEXTAUTH_SECRET: securestuffhere   # generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
         NEXTAUTH_URL: http://localhost:3000     # or https:// if using reverse proxy
       volumes:
         - ./uploads:/app/uploads          # where files/screenshots/videos are stored
       depends_on:
         db:
           condition: service_healthy

   ```

3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
